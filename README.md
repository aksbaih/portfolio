# Portfolio
This repo is a collection of the key parts of some of the coding projects I worked on in Stanford for various reasons. They are organized by the programming language used, above. Some of them are responses to coding assignments for classes, others for research, and others for coding assessemnts and personal projects. More details on each can be found in its corresponding documents.
