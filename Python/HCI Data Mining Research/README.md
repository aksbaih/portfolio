This research project investigates how the physical features of a building affect different factors of well-being of people in these environments based on their text reviews on social media (which we have collected as a dataset). Other materials, datasets, analyses, and conclusions are not public because the project is still ongoing. The document above shows a number of NLP analyses I conducted in this project as a sample showing my proficiency in Python and NLP tools.
